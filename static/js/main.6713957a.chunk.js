But even so, I still wonder if we ought to look further into the issue, which is a fecking rhetorical question, because the existance of this article means that I already have. But anyways, for this investigation, my working theory will be that Jaden Smith is right about trees, that they're acutally blue, (credit goes to Sinix Designs for pointing this out, btw,) and the reason for why we don't see trees in this way, is that we have some sort of collective mental block that prevents us from doing so. So what I want to do in this investigation, is to figure out why we have this quirk in our color perception, and I hope that in the process we can improve our awareness of our own perception, and so, improve our ability to design.",Object(f.jsx)(v,{src:q,type:"full",caption:"Underneath a tree, with some wild native plants."}),"So regarding our perception of color, I'll be taking it for granted that people who share a culture also share a system of color perception, (to a certain extent that is,) in the sense that in general, we have the ability to intuitively recognize and agree with each other on what the color of an object is, and whenever we cannot come to an agreement, there is actually great distress in our society, as seen during the unfolding of the black-and-blue dress debacle. However, while it is true that we have the ability to perceive what colors look like, this does not necessarily mean that we really know what we are perceiving. Because although in some circumstances, the color of a thing is very clear, as red is just red, and blue is just blue, in others, the color of a thing gets a bit weird, for instance with darker, or less saturated colors, like what exactly is brown, grey, beige, or white?",Object(f.jsx)(v,{src:Y,type:"full",caption:"You can easily tell by this object's red hue, that it is red."}),Object(f.jsx)(v,{src:H,type:"full",caption:"I know that this sounds like an excuse, but I don't think that my screen is even bright enough to match this grey on the wall."})]}),Object(f.jsx)(j,{variant:"h4",children:Object(f.jsx)("b",{children:"The Hue of Color"})}),Object(f.jsx)("br",{}),Object(f.jsxs)(j,{children:["If you pay attention to the way that people talk about color, you will soon realize that the word color actually has multiple meanings, and we have to infer the meaning of color based on the context in which it is used. For instance, we say that, ",Object(f.jsx)("q",{children:"red (light) has a wavelength of 650nm"}),", and that ",Object(f.jsx)("q",{children:"white is not a color, but a shade"}),". But if the definition of a color is light at a narrow band of wavelengths, (like how reds are at about 650nm,) then what is the wavelength of brown? And if brown doesn't have a narrow band of wavelengths to which it belongs, then is brown just like white, which also does not have a narrow band of wavelength to which it belongs? Then in that case is brown a color at all, is it instead a shade?",Object(f.jsx)(v,{src:P,type:"full",caption:"Brown is just orange, but sometimes its red, or yellow. - Lao Tse"}),"So for our purposes, I suggest that we break down the word color into three distinct categories, specific color, color, and hue. Now obviously, I'm a fecking idiot, so I'm not the one who came up with this distinction, as I'm simply re-mixing ideas that I've come accross over the years. But anyways, I'm suggesting that we take the word specific color to mean the name that we give to a specific RGB color code (ie. red (as a specific color) is #FF0000, and cyan (as a specific color) is #00FFFF). However, as you've probably already realized, this is not the only context in which we use the word red, as we also use it to mean a color, and what we mean by color is a range of RGB color codes that we group together, for instance in the family of reds, we also have dark red, and cherry red, and light red, et cetera.
