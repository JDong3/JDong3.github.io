But anyways, for this investigation, my working theory will be that Jaden Smith is right about trees, that they're acutally blue, (credit goes to Sinix Designs for pointing this out, btw,) and the reason for why we don't see trees in this way, is that we have some sort of collective mental block that prevents us from doing so.

However, while it is true that we have the ability to perceive what colors look like, this does not necessarily mean that we really know what we are perceiving. Because although in some circumstances, the color of a thing is very clear, as red is just red, and blue is just blue, in others, the color of a thing gets a bit weird, for instance with darker, or less saturated colors, like what exactly is brown, grey, beige, or white?",Object(b.jsx)(O,{src:q,type:"full",caption:"You can easily tell by this object's red hue, that it is red."}),Object(b.jsx)(O,{src:J,type:"full",caption:"I know that this sounds like an excuse, but I don't think that my screen is even bright enough to match this grey on the wall."})]}),Object(b.jsx)(y,{variant:"h4",children:Object(b.jsx)("b",{children:"The Hue of Color"})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsxs)(y,{children:["If you pay attention to the way that people talk about color, you will soon realize that the word color actually has multiple meanings, and we have to infer the meaning of color based on the context in which it is used.

But if the definition of a color is light at a narrow band of wavelengths, (like how reds are at about 650nm,) then what is the wavelength of brown? And if brown doesn't have a narrow band of wavelengths to which it belongs, then is brown just like white, which also does not have a narrow band of wavelength to which it belongs? Then in that case is brown a color at all, is it instead a shade?",Object(b.jsx)(O,{src:V,type:"full",caption:"Brown is just orange, but sometimes its red, or yellow. - Lao Tse"}),"So for our purposes, I suggest that we break down the word color into three distinct categories, specific color, color, and hue. Now obviously, I'm a fecking idiot, so I'm not the one who came up with this distinction, as I'm simply re-mixing ideas that I've come accross over the years. But anyways, I'm suggesting that we take the word specific color to mean the name that we give to a specific RGB color code (ie. red (as a specific color) is #FF0000, and cyan (as a specific color) is #00FFFF). However, as you've probably already realized, this is not the only context in which we use the word red, as we also use it to mean a color, and what we mean by color is a range of RGB color codes that we group together, for instance in the family of reds, we also have dark red, and cherry red, and light red, et cetera. And finally, we also see the word red being used to describe a hue, and in this instance, hue basically means the color of the dominating wavelength of light in a color, for instance red, pink, and reddish-brown, all have a red hue.",Object(b.jsx)(O,{type:"full",src:K,caption:"explain specific color vs color of tyrian purple(what is a color really) My guestimation for how tyrian purple is supposed to look.

In the context of web design, red can refer to a single color code, for instance if you give a div background:red, you will actually give the div a background specific color of #ff0000 (aka HSV 0,100,100). But red a color is a much broader idea, as I can pretty much guarantee that 99.9 or more percent of people would agree that HSV 0,95,95 is also red, in face I would say that the range of red is about 345 to 8 degrees hue, 60 to 100 percent saturation, and 60 to 100 percent value, in the HSV color space."]}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)(y,{variant:"h4",children:Object(b.jsx)("b",{children:"Colors of a Single Hue"})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)(y,{children:"But now this begs the question, if a red color implies a red hue, but a red hue doesn't imply a red color, then doesn't that mean that there are non-red color that have a red hue? Which is also a fecking rhetorical question because we've already seen that reddish-brown, and pink have red hues, yet we don't call those colors red. And I think this is really the issue that we have on the color of trees. So this is where I believe that the argument will be the most contentious, and the argument revolves around the specific color of cyan, So remember, we're still trying to answer the question of whether trees are blue or not, and spoiler alert, the solution to this issue really lies in the phenomena of boundaries of color Now there still a second complication with this definition of color, which is that color that exists on a computer, is fundamentally different than color that exists in the outside world. And what I mean by that is, if you look up the hex code to a color, for instance, ultramarine. Although we have made this distinction, there is invariably still this feeling that hue, and color are somehow interelated. And honestly this may just be an artifact of us previously referring to these now distinct salient phenomena as the same word color.

This is the type of God that we commonly debate about, and is even the default concept of God in this course. But the interesting thing is that when we really pay attention, and press people on their true meaning of God, this is not necessarily the type of God that we find in their hearts, while on the outside they will repeat the common notion of God number 1, on the inside, we find that the type of God that they experience is a some sort of personal God, a feeling, an emotion, a "transcendental vision of goodness".',Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),'Now although Paul has never explicitly stated what he means by God number 2, I have decided to take one for the team, and to bear the blame for if I\'m wrong, but I will claim now, for the sake of illustration, that God number 2 is a "transcendental vision of goodness".

Does this mean that those who have been restricted by our bullshitized society are not truly restricted? For surely in a liberal society, they can do something about their situation, and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Or is it the case, as I think, that the idea of a liberal society is just nonsensical, because a liberal society is almost by definition an unstable society, as there is no natural mechanism that prevents a liberal society from becoming an unliberal one, and in fact a liberal society actually accelerates the process of unliberalization.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"But what if what we wanted were not a liberal society, but something else. Now since I am a moral relativist, I don't truly think that there is any such a thing as absolute good, so it's hard to take myself seriously when I try to talk about the morality of a society. But while I don't think there is morality, sometimes I feel that there is actually good and bad, but even though feeling is not knowing, as feeling is emotional, and knowing is intellectual, I often feel that feeling is more real than thinking and knowing, and what I feel but do not know is that, what the ultimate good is, is happiness, which is actualizing one's potential.",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"But even if that were not true, there is still a reason for it, as there's a reason for everything, including those things are are false, for all reasons are just post-hoc justifications, and the strength of the reason just reflects the strength of the emotion. But the reason for why happiness is the ultimate good is that, the purpose of potential is to be actualized, and performing one's purpose is the ultimate meaning. If a seed does not grow into a tree, then what good is that seed? If our protoplanetary disk could not form into the earth, then what was the purpose of that protoplanetary disk?

And for the same reason, our bullshitized society is also bad, because we people are not born to stagnate, and rot, for if we do that, then we cannot actualize our potential, and so we cannot be happy. And just because it is the "state of nature", or the "state of freedom" that results in our bullshitized society, that does not mean that we should give in to it.
