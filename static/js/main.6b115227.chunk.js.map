automation testing, et cetera). On this website, you'll find a selection of articles that explain the way in which I approach life, design, and programming. You will also find some descriptions of my past work experience, and the technologies that I'm most familiar with. And just so you know, if you plan on reading the articles, they can get a bit esoteric at times, (which is expected when discussing philosophy). But anyways, whatever you're looking for on this website, I hope you find it, and enjoy the reading.\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" serif>Contents</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"#industry-experience\"><b>Industry Experience</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"#tech-stuff-i-work-with\"><b>Tech Stuff I Work With</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"#index-of-articles\"><b>Index of Articles</b></To></li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" id=\"industry-experience\" serif>Industry Experience</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Customer Experience Analysis (Internship) at IBM</b></Text>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <b>May 2019 - August 2020</b>\r\n\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <br/>\r\n\r\n                During my time at IBM, I was part of the Customer Experience Analysis (CEA) team, which was one of the teams that worked on IBM's hybrid-cloud machine learning platform (CPD). The purpose of the CEA team was actually not very clear me for a long time, as I've never heard of such a team before I joined one. But eventually I figured out that the purpose of our team was to use our influence to try and get the other teams to co-operate on isses that affected the quality of the platform overall, that none of them wanted to address individually. I basically just worked on software that generated reports that the management on our team used to make their cases.\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Automation Testing (Internship) at Caseware Intl.</b></Text>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <b>January 2018 - August 2018</b>\r\n\r\n                <br/>\r\n                <br/>\r\n\r\n                When I was Caseware, I was on the QA team for their cloud-based auditing platform (Smart Engagement), and as you may imagine, the purpose of this team was a lot more clear than that of the CEA team. And being a smaller project in scope as well, it seemed that we could elicit inter-team co-operation by simply shoving all 20 or so people involved on the project into a single room, and just talking it out. Being the QA team, we were responsible for ensuring the quality of the platform, which in our case, meant that we had to ensure that the functions of the platform worked as intended, and we did this with a combination of manual and automated tests, which I worked on both.\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" id=\"tech-stuff-i-work-with\" serif>Tech Stuff I Work With</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <TechCard title=\"Software Collaboration Tools (Git, Github, Bitbucket)\" style={{borderRadius: '15px'}} src={github}>\r\n\r\n                Version Control Software or VCS is the base tool that allows programmers to effectively collaborate on code, examples of this would be Git, or SVN. Services like Github, or BitBucket are platorms that host VCS servers, and integrate many of the VCS features into a GUI that allows idiots like myself to use them more effectively. In my time, since I've often had to collaborate on code with others, I've become quite familiar with the standard VCS usage, (code reviews, pull requests, branching, merging, et cetera).\r\n\r\n            </TechCard>\r\n\r\n            <TechCard title=\"The Web Stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript)\" src={js}>\r\n\r\n                In our modern times, the web platform consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML is the core, and the primary information carrying component of the bunch, CSS, which in my opinion is not really necessary, styles the web, and makes branding over the internet possible, JavaScript, which I believe is the real travestry essentially turns the web into a platform emulator, which would have been completely unnecessary if the OS producers could have just agreed on a common application API.\r\n\r\n            </TechCard>\r\n\r\n            <TechCard title=\"Various Web Frameworks (React, Flask, Material UI)\" src={react}>\r\n\r\n                But since the web is already a platform emulator, and there really seems to be no going back, (which by the way to make my point more clear, look at ChromeOS and tell me that Google doesn't already think that the web should be used as the base platform of personal computing,) web frameworks are what makes the prospect of developing on the platform tolerable, as base JavaScript was not intended to be used to make these complicated web applications.\r\n\r\n            </TechCard>\r\n\r\n            <TechCard title=\"Database Technologies (SQL, Relational Databases)\" src={sql}>\r\n\r\n                The entire space of databases is essentially concerned with the issue of reading and writing permanant records efficiently. Now the technical details of these systems have more or less been worked out long before my time, so it seems that our generation of programmers only need to be concerned with learning to program with the APIs of these systems. Which in the context of the basic applications that we develop nowadays, that means implementing systems of user information storage, inventory management, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n            </TechCard>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" id=\"index-of-articles\" serif>Index of Articles</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"/the-evolutionary-origins-of-truth\" link scroll><b>The Evolutionary Origins of Truth</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"/the-virus-of-progress\" link scroll><b>The Virus of Progress</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"/speculation-on-paul-vanderklays-god-number-2\" link scroll><b>Speculation On Paul Vanderklay's God Number 2</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"/the-true-motivation-of-business\" link scroll><b>The True Motivation of Business</b></To></li>\r\n                    <li><To href=\"/scientific-theories-as-truth\" link scroll><b>Scientific Theories as Truth</b></To></li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Introductions\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/mtab.8a65e019.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/grey-match.91b85a82.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/red-match.a2769671.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/brown-match.c337e654.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/blueblue-spruce.569d35e2.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/blue-spruce.1f8bbd92.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/green-yellow.fac3e38e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/under-the-tree.e4300ff7.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tyrian-purple.ddbd06cd.png\";","import {\r\n    Idea,\r\n    Text,\r\n    Hr,\r\n    Img\r\n} from '../../colorful-text'\r\nimport mtab from './assets/mtab.png'\r\nimport greyMatch from './assets/grey-match.jpg'\r\nimport redMatch from './assets/red-match.jpg'\r\nimport brownMatch from './assets/brown-match.jpg'\r\nimport blueSpruce from './assets/blue-spruce.jpg'\r\nimport blueblueSpruce from './assets/blueblue-spruce.jpg'\r\nimport greenYellow from './assets/green-yellow.jpg'\r\nimport underTheTree from './assets/under-the-tree.jpg'\r\nimport tyrianPurple from './assets/tyrian-purple.png'\r\n\r\nimport Bass from '../Bass.js'\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * why trees are actually blue\r\n * first do a color matching experiment, then start speculating on why stuff....\r\n * ambiguous categories\r\n * weird color theory\r\n * pre-disposed to believe that trees are green\r\n */\r\n\r\nlet MostTreesAreBlue = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Bass>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h1\" id=\"most-trees-are-blue\" serif>Most Trees Are Blue</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={1}/>\r\n\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <Img src={mtab} type=\"full\" caption=\"Screenshot of Jaden Smith's 'Most Trees Are Blue' tweet.\"></Img>\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" serif>Contents</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <a href=\"#most-trees-are-ablue\"><Text><li>Most Trees Are Blue</li></Text></a>\r\n                    <a href=\"#article\"><Text><li>Article\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>hi</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n\r\n                    </li></Text></a>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" id=\"article\" serif>Article</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Do we See Color Properly?</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n\r\n                At first glance, the idea that <i><q>most trees are blue</q></i> is simply absurd, because just from our everyday experience, we know that most trees are green. But even so, I still wonder if we ought to look further into the issue, which is a fecking rhetorical question, because the existance of this article means that I already have. But anyways, for this investigation, my working theory will be that Jaden Smith is right about trees, that they're acutally blue, (credit goes to Sinix Designs for pointing this out, btw,) and the reason for why we don't see trees in this way, is that we have some sort of collective mental block that prevents us from doing so. So what I want to do in this investigation, is to figure out why we have this quirk in our color perception, and I hope that in the process we can improve our awareness of our own perception, and so, improve our ability to design.\r\n\r\n                <Img src={underTheTree} type=\"full\" caption=\"Underneath a tree, with some wild native plants.\"/>\r\n\r\n                So regarding our perception of color, I'll be taking it for granted that people who share a culture also share a system of color perception, (to a certain extent that is,) in the sense that in general, we have the ability to intuitively recognize and agree with each other on what the color of an object is, and whenever we cannot come to an agreement, there is actually great distress in our society, as seen during the unfolding of the black-and-blue dress debacle. However, while it is true that we have the ability to perceive what colors look like, this does not necessarily mean that we really know what we are perceiving. Because although in some circumstances, the color of a thing is very clear, as red is just red, and blue is just blue, in others, the color of a thing gets a bit weird, for instance with darker, or less saturated colors, like what exactly is brown, grey, beige, or white?\r\n\r\n                <Img src={redMatch} type=\"full\" caption=\"You can easily tell by this object's red hue, that it is red.\"/>\r\n\r\n                <Img src={greyMatch} type=\"full\" caption=\"I know that this sounds like an excuse, but I don't think that my screen is even bright enough to match this grey on the wall.\"/>\r\n\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The Hue of Color</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n\r\n                If you pay attention to the way that people talk about color, you will soon realize that the word color actually has multiple meanings, and we have to infer the meaning of color based on the context in which it is used. For instance, we say that, <q>red (light) has a wavelength of 650nm</q>, and that <q>white is not a color, but a shade</q>. But if the definition of a color is light at a narrow band of wavelengths, (like how reds are at about 650nm,) then what is the wavelength of brown? And if brown doesn't have a narrow band of wavelengths to which it belongs, then is brown just like white, which also does not have a narrow band of wavelength to which it belongs? Then in that case is brown a color at all, is it instead a shade?\r\n\r\n                <Img src={brownMatch} type=\"full\" caption=\"Brown is just orange, but sometimes its red, or yellow. - Lao Tse\"/>\r\n\r\n                So for our purposes, I suggest that we break down the word color into three distinct categories, specific color, color, and hue. Now obviously, I'm a fecking idiot, so I'm not the one who came up with this distinction, as I'm simply re-mixing ideas that I've come accross over the years. But anyways, I'm suggesting that we take the word specific color to mean the name that we give to a specific RGB color code (ie. red (as a specific color) is #FF0000, and cyan (as a specific color) is #00FFFF). However, as you've probably already realized, this is not the only context in which we use the word red, as we also use it to mean a color, and what we mean by color is a range of RGB color codes that we group together, for instance in the family of reds, we also have dark red, and cherry red, and light red, et cetera. And finally, we also see the word red being used to describe a hue, and in this instance, hue basically means the color of the dominating wavelength of light in a color, for instance red, pink, and reddish-brown, all have a red hue.\r\n\r\n                <Img type=\"full\" src={tyrianPurple} caption=\"explain specific color vs color of tyrian purple(what is a color really) My guestimation for how tyrian purple is supposed to look. If you look up the hex code, it says that it should be a bit redder than this. But if you really think about it, that color you see if you look it up isn't necessarily 'the' tyrian purple, because tyrian purple was used to dye cloths back in the day, and different makers of the dye would have different colors of it, and the cloth would also be different colors in different lighting, so who really knows what tyrian purple is supposed to look like.\"/>\r\n\r\n                So just to make these definitions clear, lets expand on the example of red. In the context of web design, red can refer to a single color code, for instance if you give a div background:red, you will actually give the div a background specific color of #ff0000 (aka HSV 0,100,100). But red a color is a much broader idea, as I can pretty much guarantee that 99.9 or more percent of people would agree that HSV 0,95,95 is also red, in face I would say that the range of red is about 345 to 8 degrees hue, 60 to 100 percent saturation, and 60 to 100 percent value, in the HSV color space.\r\n\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Colors of a Single Hue</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n                But now this begs the question, if a red color implies a red hue, but a red hue doesn't imply a red color, then doesn't that mean that there are non-red color that have a red hue? Which is also a fecking rhetorical question because we've already seen that reddish-brown, and pink have red hues, yet we don't call those colors red. And I think this is really the issue that we have on the color of trees.\r\n\r\n                So this is where I believe that the argument will be the most contentious, and the argument revolves around the specific color of cyan,\r\n\r\n\r\n                So remember, we're still trying to answer the question of whether trees are blue or not, and spoiler alert, the solution to this issue really lies in the phenomena of boundaries of color\r\n\r\n                Now there still a second complication with this definition of color, which is that color that exists on a computer, is fundamentally different than color that exists in the outside world. And what I mean by that is, if you look up the hex code to a color, for instance, ultramarine.\r\n\r\n                Although we have made this distinction, there is invariably still this feeling that hue, and color are somehow interelated. And honestly this may just be an artifact of us previously referring to these now distinct salient phenomena as the same word color. And in practice, things that we call a distinct color, span hue, as well as saturation, and value, (in the HSV color space). For example red.\r\n            </Text>\r\n\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\">What about trees</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={2}/>\r\n            <Text>\r\n\r\n                Given that some trees are <i>literally</i> blue, and that green, the color that we think trees are, is already pretty close to blue, I don&apos;t think its too much of a stretch to also start seeing most trees as blue. But obviously, I'm not overtly delusional, and I am aware that trees, in many situations have almost no blueness, for instance in bright sunlight, the coolness of blue is gone, replaced with a warm yellow glow.\r\n\r\n                <Img src={greenYellow} type=\"full\" caption=\"hello\"/>\r\n\r\n                But is the yellow from these trees from the tree itself, or is it only yellow from the sunlight. Now I do know that the color of sunlight itself can be a bit of a pretentious topic, because people seem to have different definitions of what sunlight means, now it is the case, (or at least I've been told that it's the case by the scientific types,) that sunlight, when it leaves the sun, is more or less white, but to our experience, this light is literally yellow, as we can see from the photo above, and I've been told that that's due to <i>Reighleigh Scattering</i>, but for the my purposes, I will just go with our experience and say that sunlight is yellow.\r\n\r\n                <br/><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                So I wonder, if we accept the premise that our perception is flawed, meaning that what we see is not reality, then do we open the doors to wonder if the green that we see from the trees, is really from the tree, and how much of the green that we see is all in our heads, having been told by our educators that trees are green. But that question aside, we may as well start with in my opinion, a quite obviously blue tree,the blue spruce.\r\n\r\n                <Img src={blueblueSpruce} type=\"full\" caption=\"A photo of 'blue' spruce.

In fact, this is actually case for most things. For example, lets take a look at a computer. A computer is a common office, and household electronic device that’s used for work, and recreation. But, it’s also a collection of memory, computation units, hard disk, etc. We don’t say that one of these definitions of a computer is wrong and the other is right, because that just doesn’t make sense in this context. Instead we can interpret these definitions as encapsulating different aspects of the computer, one of them being the components of the computer, and the other being the uses of a computer.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            What I wan’t to talk about today is a specific kind of idea which I’m going to call “scientific theories”. For our purposes, a scientific theory is any idea that proposes an explanation for the mechanics behind some phenomena that we might experience, so this is a bit more broad that what scientists today might call a scientific theory. What we’re concerned with today is the peculiar behaviours of these scientific theories, where they come from, and what is their purpose.\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The Reality vs Perception</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <Text>Do we “know” what reality “is”? Well actually no, because if we’re both looking at a tree, in most circumstances its pretty safe to say that we both see a tree. But we don’t actually see the same thing. Because we have we have different eyes, and minds, so is seems reasonable to think that both the raw data going into our sensors, and the interpretation of that data, would be different. So there is no reason to believe that we should see the same image of the tree, or feel the same emotions by looking at the tree.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            This suggests that what we experience is not the reality, but a modified reality that is influenced by ourselves and our culture. From here on out, for non-confusion purposes, I’m going to refer to what we understand to be the real world, as reality, and what we experience, as our perception.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            What we normally think of as reality is actually not the real thing, but our perception. So in a sense our notions and beliefs are not based in some absolute reality, but they are necessarily based in our perception which is influenced by ourselves and our culture.

According to the Greeks, the world is made of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water. Now each of these elements have a natural place, like earth is beneath us, and air is above us. However upon being disturbed, these elements wish to return to their natural places, so if you throw a rock upwards, it falls back down because the rock is made of earth, and the earth wishes to return to its natural place.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But here’s the thing, what is the meaning of natural place? Why do rocks wish to go back to their natural place? And do rocks really wish for anything? Aren’t these just magical notions that don’t reflect reality.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            So what we say nowadays is that its Newton’s equations of gravity tells us the real reason for why things fall. And this gravity also happens to be the same reason for why the planets go round the sun, and why the moon goes round the earth. Gravity is a force that is felt by a pair of objects in a direction that pulls them together, and it is dependent on the masses of the two objects, and how nea r they are to each other.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But here’s the thing, why do we say that Newton is right, and the Greeks are wrong? Well thats because unlike the Greek’s theory, Newton’s theory is true, which is half true. Because the greek theories are also true, in that they also correspond to reality, since after all the Greek’s predict that rocks fall down, and they do.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            The difference is that Newton’s theory make sense for us, in our modern context, because in our modern world we happen to require more from our scientific theories than that Greek theory can provide. But this does not mean that Newton’s theory is absolutely true, because first off we actually know that Newton’s theory doesn’t actually correspond to reality as Einstein developed a more powerful theory of general relativity.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But not only that, Newton’s theory actually contains the same magical notions that the Greek’s theory did. Because consider what it means for “gravity” to be a force. What causes the direction of that force, why is it dependent on distance and mass. What is mass, and why do forces make objects move.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now this isn’t to say that we shouldn’t use Newton’s theories because they contain magical notions, because our scientific theories will always contain magical notions. As the old magical notions are replaced with more fundamental parts, the structure of those more fundamental parts become the new magical notions, so its magical notions all the way down. But it doesn’t matter because they work, which is exactly what we need from our scientific theories.</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>On the Nature of Logic</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>Our pride of modern scientific thinking is that our theories don’t rely on any magical notions, but instead on logic, and reason alone. But what is logic?\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            These are the rules of logic. There are other rules and extensions of logic, but all of propositioal, and first order logic can be derived from just these rules here. These tables govern the behaviour of creating compound statements with the “not”, “and”, and “or” operators respectively. We can take a look at one of the rules to get an idea for what the tables mean. For example we can take a look at this row in the “or” table.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            This row tells us what type of statement we’ll get if we combine A a true statement, and B and false statement with the “or” operator. Lets say that A is something true, like the sky is blue, and B is something false like 1 + 1 = 3. Now the combined statement, the sky is blue or 1 + 1 = 3, is true.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now all of this seems reasonable, but there’s always the question of where do these rules come from. The answer being that they don’t. We call the rules of logic axiomatic because they are not justified, because they can’t be justified.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            The thing about logic is that logic itself is also a scientific theory, whereby the rules have been crafted by our experience and languages, in order to categorize, and combine other things that we know about. However, like other scientic theories, logic is necessarily also magical.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Magic, like truth, is composed of separate but related aspects. One aspect of magic is the showmanship, and wonder that you would see at a magic show. But another aspect of magic is the unexplained, or the mystery, which is exactly what we are seeing from logic.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            I want to reiterate that saying logic is magical is not me telling you to not use logic, because we are not concerned about whether logic is magical or not, only that it works.</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Conclusions?</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <Text>Its a truism that all roads lead to Darwinism. Our idea of usefulness is related to the things that we wan’t. And at least in theory, the things that we desire, should be related to things that increase our chances of survival. And scientific theories seem to be things that increase our chances of getting the things that we want. For example, if we want to launch a satellite into orbit, we need to have good scientific theories on the behaviour of rockets, orbital trajectories, composite materials, etc.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            And in this context it becomes clear that there is no pressure in the systems of scientific theory formation that attempts to remove magical thinking, if that’s even possible. But the main pressure is just to come up with theories that work well enough so that we can do whatever it is that we want to do.</Text>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Speculation\r\n","import Bass from '../Bass.js'\r\nimport {\r\n    Text,\r\n    Hr,\r\n} from '../../colorful-text'\r\n\r\n\r\nlet Speculation = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Bass>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h3\" serif>Speculation on Paul Vanderklay's God No.2</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={1}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <Text>\r\n                Paul VanderKlay is a Youtuber and a minister of a Christian Reformed church in Sacramento, California. Out of the goodness of his heart, he has dedicated many hours of his life to explaining concepts about God, and Christianity to the general public, and he has since amassed a sizable following (18.7 thousand followers as of June 25th, 2021) considering the fact that many people nowadays are not very interested in hearing people talk at length about God. In his lectures, he often refers to God as a multifaceted thing-being-force, noting that there are at least two salient conceptions of God, God number 1, and God number 2. God number 1, which is the common folk conception of God among Christians and Atheists alike, is God as superman, infinite speed, infinite strength, infinite intellect. This is the type of God that we commonly debate about, and is even the default concept of God in this course. But the interesting thing is that when we really pay attention, and press people on their true meaning of God, this is not necessarily the type of God that we find in their hearts, while on the outside they will repeat the common notion of God number 1, on the inside, we find that the type of God that they experience is a some sort of personal God, a feeling, an emotion, a \"transcendental vision of goodness\".\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n                Now although Paul has never explicitly stated what he means by God number 2, I have decided to take one for the team, and to bear the blame for if I'm wrong, but I will claim now, for the sake of illustration, that God number 2 is a \"transcendental vision of goodness\". And what I mean by that, is a vision of morality, and purpose that goes beyond ourselves, in the sense that, it is better to use my resources to help someone else in need, rather than to increase the luxury of my own life, or that it is better to sacrifice my personal comfort in order to maintain a friendship, rather than to let it go.\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                Now, to test out this hypothesis, and to expand our understanding of what God is, I propose that we do some sort of experiment, where whenever I say God, I want you to replace that word in your mind with \"a transcendental vision of goodness\". And my hypothesis is that when I use the word \"God\", what I write will sound like I took a page straight out of the orthodox Christian doctrine, but when you replace that word with \"a transcendental vision of goodness\" in your mind, then it will sound like I am speaking about ethical theory\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                For example, if it were the case that God (a transcendental vision of goodness) exists, then ought we not to live our lives in accordance, and striving towards God (that transcendental vision of goodness). For how can we, if we know that God exists, live with ourselves knowing that we have chosen to reject him? Basically implying that if we know that there is a higher standard of morals, but we decide to actively reject it, then how can we consider ourselves as ethical people.\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                If God is that transcendental vision of goodness, then simply by definition, God ought to be morally perfect. For if God is not perfect, then that thing which we call God, is not the true God, but a false one.\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                Since the will of God has been revealed to us through visions, and holy texts, the existence of these things means that God wills for us to apply them, and since we can only do the will of God if we're able to, then we must be able to, and that ability is free will. This is basically saying that since the idea of a transcendental goodness is salient, then that idea must have some significance to us, but the idea of a transcendental goodness is useless if we cannot actually work towards it. So in some way, if we believe in a transcendental goodness, and want that belief to actually matter, then we are also forced to adopt a belief in free will, because the purpose of an ideal is to strive towards it, so if you believe that you can't (which is a lack of free will), then there is no purpose in believing in that ideal in the first place.\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                If God has given us a body, and we are free to use it in ways that glorify him, then why should we fear death? For if its the case that we die in old age, after having spent a lifetime in the garden, in the presence of God, then we should die without regret, for while we were alive and able, we have done what was good. But if we die at a young age, or suddenly, and have not yet completed the cultivation our virtues, then our death should be mourned, for there was potential, but that potential was never actualized. This is basically saying that if \"God\", (and this time we're using the idea of God in a more personal sense because it feels right,) has given us a body, which more or less just means that \"since we find ourselves to have a body\" or \"since the 'universe' has given us a body\", then we ought to use our body to do tasks which exemplify our vision of what is the transcendental goodness. And with regards to dying, we should not fear death if we have lived virtuously and without regret, but only if we have not yet become a virtuous person should we be afraid, and this gives us the motivation to become virtuous now, and not later.\r\n                <br/><br/>\r\n                Put your trust in God, for God is good, for if you put your faith in the light, it will lead you salvation, and the worship of false idols will destroy you. If you put your trust in the transcendental vision of goodness, assuming that it is the ultimate transcendental vision of goodness, then by definition, you will have lived the most virtuous life, and the life that was full of the most goodness, and that is your salvation. And the worship of a false idol, which is the belief in a faulty transcendental vision of goodness, will lead you astray, and make you live unvirtuously, all the while still believing that you are virtuous, and this will destroy your soul.\r\n            </Text>\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Speculation\r\n","import Bass from '../Bass.js'\r\nimport {\r\n    Text,\r\n    Hr\r\n} from '../../colorful-text'\r\n\r\nlet Article = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Bass>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h2\" serif>The Evolutionary Origins of Truth</Text>\r\n            <Hr type={1}/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Why I Believe in Free Will and Determinism</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>As we live and walk around in our world, we perceive different things through our senses, and so over time, we come to form certain conclusions about the things that we see.

But I posit that truth is actually multifaceted, and that there are actually two different kinds of truth *formal*, and *darwinion*.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            When I say formal truth, I mean a kind of truth that is derived from a formalized system of reasoning. Take statistical theory for example, in the system that is statistical theory, we say that it is possible, (under certain circumstances and assumptions,) to conduct a study to tell if cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. If it were the case that exposure to asbestos, and smog were the only confounding variables for lung cancer, then in our study, if we were to split the participants into three groups (exposure to smog, exposure to asbestos, and everyone else), then any correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer that we find within each of these groups is a direct causation. This is the kind of truth that is well behaved, binary, and absolute, and what most people in our culture think of when we say truth.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But the other kind of truth, which is really the one that we're interested in today, is a darwinion truth, which is more or less a *though pattern that persists over time*, examples of these kinds of truth would be things like \"our father is in heaven\", or \"God has given us a free will\". Now of course, I'm not claiming that superstitions are truth, but what I think that many people nowadays fail to understand is that religion is not mere superstition, and in some sense, I believe that these things which I have labeled as darwinion truth are even truer than the formal truth itself, as I soon hope to convince you that formalized truth is actually just a derivative of the more generalized darwinion truth.</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>How Ideas Evolve Over Time</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>Now what I'm calling darwinion truth, I believe is really just an extension of pragmatic truth, so I believe that we can motivate darwinion truth by simply adopting the pragmatic attitude, which is to grant an idea or belief to be true, and to judge it by seeing what its practical effects are [James, Lecture VI Pragmatism's Conception of Truth]. And in the case for darwinion truth, the practical effect that matters to us is its contribution to (darwinion) fitness.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now the way in which a thought pattern affects the fitness of a person is though influencing their behavioral patterns, for example, if a person is believes that their life has no purpose, and that their birth was a mistake, then they will behave in ways that reflect those beliefs, for example, they may neglect to take care of themselves, or they may act resentfully towards their parents, and those actions would be detrimental to their fitness. So where genetics are a physical encoding of information who's viability is expressed through the quality of the body of a person, ideas are a mental encoding of information who's viability is expressed though the quality of the actions of a person. And just like genetics (and any other *thing* that contributes to the fitness of a person), ideas will also go through a process of natural selection, where over time, the ideas that result in good fitness are remembered, and those that are not, are lost to the sands of time, and those ideas that are remembered are then spread, and so they live on, and mutate, (and by mutate, I mean that the idea is able to be \"iterated\" upon, in the sense that rock music is an iteration of blues music).</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The Legitimacy of Darwinion Truth</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>But of course, just because an idea is evolutionary successful, it does not mean that we should call it truth. But the reason why I see it as truth is because truth itself is just a category, and since it is held in high esteem, it must have some sort of function that distinguishes itself from other categories, and I posit that that function is its ability to produce desirable results when applied. For example, lets take a formalized truth like \"smoking causes lung cancer\", why do we say that this statement is true? Well you might say that its true because the result comes from statistical theory, but why don't we first take a step back, because to me, it seems like that statement derives its legitimacy from the fact that when applied, it produces desired results, in the sense that if we convince the public of the opposite, and encourage smoking, then we would have an absolute clusterfuck of a heath crisis on our hands.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But even if you do not believe me, and insist that the reason why that statement is true, is not due to that fact that it produces good results, but due to that fact that it comes from statistical theory, then let me ask you, why do results that come from statistical theory have legitimacy? You might be tempted to say that the reason for why results that come from statistical theory have legitimacy, is because statistical theory is derived from logic, and logic is the fundamental system that derives all truth. But is that really true? Because if logic is what produces truth, and truth serves no special function, then truth is just another category, and doesn't deserve to be held in high esteem. The reason why we hold logic in high esteem, and we mistakenly see it as the source of truth, is because logic is able to produce powerful systems of reasoning, like statistics, and physics, etc., and those systems that logic creates produces good results. So in the end, even if this statement ultimately derives its legitimacy from logic, logic itself derives its legitimacy from producing good results, so this statement still derives its legitimacy from its ability to produce good results.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now this is were we come to the view of truth that I advocate for, which is more or less a re-framed version of the pragmatic truth, which is that ideas that produce good results are true, and what evolution is, is that system which selects for these true ideas over time. And so these so called darwinion truths, which are the ideas that have persisted over the long run, are basically the truest ideas. So from this point of view, the logical system itself is simply one of these darwinion truths, and not the real source of it all.</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Darwinion Truth and Free Will and Determinism</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>But now onto the topic of free will and determinism, what I posit is that both the belief in free will, and the belief in determinism, are darwinion truths, and that the belief in free will, being a more ancient one, is thus truer than our belief in determinism. And also since these beliefs are so ingrained into our culture and language, and that our culture is also prestigious (although the prestige of our culture is currently waning), these things point to the belief in free will and determinism being darwinion.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            But to elaborate and to provide some post-hoc justification, we can say that it was our belief in free will that allowed us to strive towards the creation of a better society, for if we believed that we did not have free will, then we could not possibly make any efforts towards that goal, as we could only ride on the tide of history, but not shape it. And if we did not believe in free will, then we could also not justify punishing people for their ill deeds, and honoring them for their good deeds, and we could also not decide to take responsibility for our own actions, and to discipline ourselves to become better citizens, and if we could not do that, then we could not strive to reach the ultimate goal, which is self-actualization. And the reason for why we believe in determinism, is that that belief provides the motivation for us to to study the world around us, and to search for patterns in the natural world, which is the foundation of all of our scientific endeavors.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            And since these beliefs have both stood the test of time, and proven to be beneficial for us, we ought to call them truth, as these things are the fundamental purpose of truth, and that since these ideas are more fundamental than logic itself, logic telling us that that they are a contradiction is not a reason for us to abandon them.</Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Works Cited</b></Text>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Text>\"Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking\", by William James</Text>\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Article\r\n","import Bass from '../Bass.js'\r\nimport {\r\n    Text,\r\n    Hr\r\n} from '../../colorful-text'\r\n\r\n\r\nlet TheVirusOfProgress = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Bass>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h1\" serif>The Virus of Progress</Text>\r\n        <Hr type={1}/>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Liberality, Happiness, and Goodness</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            Is liberality a means to achieve goodness, or is it a goodness in itself? If liberality were goodness in itself, then we should expect a liberal society to be a good society, but if it were only a means, then we should know that even though liberality is often conducive to goodness, sometimes it also produces badness. If happiness were goodness, and liberality just a means, then what is happy supersedes what is free, so if we could not be both happy and free, then we would rather be happy and not free. So if we found our state to be in a condition of disrepair and unhealth, and that this condition were caused by the liberality of the people, then we should for the sake of what is the ultimate good, curtail the liberality, and re-establish happiness in our state.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b> The Cause of the Bullshitization of our Society</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            According to Graeber, there is currently an increasing amount of \"bullshitization\" in our society, which is a process by which we've been creating fundamentally non-productive jobs (aka bullshit jobs). And that this bullshitization is driven by the forces of increasing efficiency, and a state-wide work cult [Graeber, 178].\r\n\r\n            Now what \"efficiency\" is, is really just a by-product of \"progress\", and what progress is, is really just a \"naturally occurring autonomous self-perpetuating self-replicating all-consuming virus\". And progress forms whenever the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>The citizens have a love of material wealth.</li>\r\n                <li>The citizens, through an investigation of the natural world, have discovered a machine which transmutes matter into material wealth, which can be improved upon with further investigation of the natural world (basically the industrial and scientific revolutions).</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n            For when these elements come into contact, the unstoppable \"progress\" is set into motion. The citizens, due to their love of material wealth, seek to acquire these matter transmuting machines, but also dissatisfied with the current amount of weath these machines generate, invest their profits into the further research of these machines, to acquire even more material wealth, and this cycle continues until the world is consumed (see peak oil, peak phosphorus, water shortage, climate change, etc.), and so, a by-product of progress is a constant improvement of these machines, which is manifest as increasing efficiency.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            But efficiency alone does not explain our predicament, since if were possible for few, though the use of machines, to provide for the needs of many, then we would just have few dedicated towards producing the necessary materials to support the many, and then have the many, dedicated towards more transcendental endeavors.\r\n\r\n            But due to our state religion, which does not tolerate living without work and suffering, when our efficiency increases, we are caught in a dilemma whereby we do not all have to work to live, but we will also not allow anyone to live who does not work. But since we also cannot allow too many people to die from poverty in our state, we've created for ourselves a public-private welfare-capital-nanny-state-complex whereby we invent imaginary jobs, for people to do imaginary work, so that we can pay them imaginary money.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The Judgement of our Current State of Affairs</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            Now I do not know what is good or bad, as whatever I feel is good I call good, and the same for what is bad, and often times my feelings come into conflict with the feelings and knowledge of other people. But I do know that many people in our state think that liberty is what is good, so if that were the case then if we find that our state is free, then it should surely be good.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Our state, along with its current bullshitization, seems to be free at least in theory, as we've already theorized that our current predicament is a result of progress and our state religion. But what I've failed to mention, (since it is taken for granted in our state,) is that progress does not work without liberty, as when the citizens try to summon progress into an illiberal state, they are swiftly neutralized by the authorities who view progress as destabilizing, so since progress has gotten so out of hand in our state, that is a sign that our state had a general policy of liberality. And regards to our state religion, a religion is really just the distilled-transcendental-vision-of-the-highest-good in a culture, so it's really due to our own circumstances and experiences, and though no coercion of outside forces, that we've come to believe that work leads to salvation. So if both progress, and our religion, are the results of the voluntary actions of the people in our state, then it seems to me that the resulting state of affairs would be liberal.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            But there seems to be something fundamentally unliberal about the bullshitization of our society. For those who who hold bullshit jobs, know that their jobs are bullshit, and knowing that their jobs are bullshit, they also know that their work has no true purpose. But by faith, also believing that those who don't work deserve to die, they must also wonder if those who pretend to work, also deserve to die. And if instead they refuse to face their condition, and choose to delude themselves, believing that their work is somehow useful, should we be so surprised when we find that there are suicidals, and delusionals abound in our state? (Mental health crisis anyone?) And at the same time, people who hold bullshit jobs have their liberty restricted, as those that hate the fact that they do real work, having held a bullshit job for so long, also cannot leave, having developed few marketable skills in their employment.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            But this is strange, because if it was liberty that resulted in the bullshitization of our society, then how can our bullshitized society be unliberal? Does this mean that those who have been restricted by our bullshitized society are not truly restricted? For surely in a liberal society, they can do something about their situation, and pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Or is it the case, as I think, that the idea of a liberal society is just nonsensical, because a liberal society is almost by definition an unstable society, as there is no natural mechanism that prevents a liberal society from becoming an unliberal one, and in fact a liberal society actually accelerates the process of unliberalization.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            But what if what we wanted were not a liberal society, but something else. Now since I am a moral relativist, I don't truly think that there is any such a thing as absolute good, so it's hard to take myself seriously when I try to talk about the morality of a society. But while I don't think there is morality, sometimes I feel that there is actually good and bad, but even though feeling is not knowing, as feeling is emotional, and knowing is intellectual, I often feel that feeling is more real than thinking and knowing, and what I feel but do not know is that, what the ultimate good is, is happiness, which is actualizing one's potential.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            But even if that were not true, there is still a reason for it, as there's a reason for everything, including those things are are false, for all reasons are just post-hoc justifications, and the strength of the reason just reflects the strength of the emotion. But the reason for why happiness is the ultimate good is that, the purpose of potential is to be actualized, and performing one's purpose is the ultimate meaning. If a seed does not grow into a tree, then what good is that seed? If our protoplanetary disk could not form into the earth, then what was the purpose of that protoplanetary disk? If a person, who has infinite potential, and who's purpose is to realize it does not, then what was the point of that life?\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            If our state had wealth in abundance, and all of the citizens engaged in a life of idleness and luxury, what good would that state be? That would not be a good state, but a bad one, for in that kind of state, there is the largest amount of wasted human potential. And for the same reason, our bullshitized society is also bad, because we people are not born to stagnate, and rot, for if we do that, then we cannot actualize our potential, and so we cannot be happy. And just because it is the \"state of nature\", or the \"state of freedom\" that results in our bullshitized society, that does not mean that we should give in to it. We must live, and die, and struggle, so that one day we may attain the ultimate goodness, that is only human.\r\n        </Text>\r\n\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Works Cited</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\"Bullshit Jobs\", by David Graeber</Text>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TheVirusOfProgress\r\n","import Bass from '../Bass.js'\r\nimport {\r\n    Text,\r\n    Hr,\r\n\r\n} from '../../colorful-text'\r\n\r\nlet TheTrueMotivationOfBusiness = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Bass>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h2\" serif>The True Motivation of Business</Text>\r\n        <Hr type={1}/>\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Intention Determines the Result</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            If the true intention of the market is not efficiency, then the market cannot bring it about, and since it cannot bring it about, it cannot be its implicit morality.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The True Intention of Business</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            According to Heath, when businesses in the market operate freely, prices are driven to market clearing levels, and that justifies their operation [Heath, 6]. On first inspection, this seems like a good justification, because if allowing free enterprise, (which is conducive to liberty,) also maximizes the prosperity of our citizens, then why would we disallow such an economic system? But while this account is very favorable, it doesn't seem to work out emprically, as from our observations of markets in real life, while it is true that we do see a tendency towards efficiency, that is not the only, (and I posit not the primary,) tendency that we see. It seems to me that efficiency is only an instrumental tendency of businesses, and that its true tendency is something more akin to statehood.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>The Desire for Self-Preservation</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            Nowadays when poeple think of power, what comes to mind is probably a state, as in our time, states are the most prominent (and stable) type of power. But state is not the only type power, and power is not one, but fractal, as there are powers within powers, and powers form complicated webs of alliances. But since powers live and die, like us, they do not wish to stagnate and rot, but instead they compete in darwinion fashion within the realm of powers. Militaries, which are a power within the state, have been known to become the state (military coups), and businesses, commonly thought of as a lower power, have been known to become the military (mercenary armies), or even suzerains of another state (corporations as suzerains of banana republics). So powers live, die, and compete, and powers of a certain class, can evolve into powers of another class, so in the end, they are not so different, as they all share the same darwinion urge for self preservation, and thus strive towards statehood.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Efficiency is Instrumental to Power and Thus Survival</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            The instrumentality of efficiency to power, is the result of the current order of the world, whereby power is predicated on influence, influence on dependence, and dependence on efficiency (which attracts people). The people are attracted to efficiency for the reason that efficiency improves their material conditions, but efficiency, especially the type brought about by hyper-specialization, does not come without the cost of dependence. For behold, in our society, the people have a great neurotic fear of unemployment, the reason being that while it is true that those who are employed have access to the necessities of life at low cost, those who are not, being part of a specialized society, have forgotten the old ways of self-sufficiency, and so become paupers. And it is for this reason, that efficiency then develops into a dependence, and this dependence into a love, and admiration for our captor, the corporation who provides for us, and so, we grant it our power, and it gains influence.\r\n\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Self-Preservation Seen in Influential Business</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            In the case of those businesses already with high influence, the true instrumental nature of efficiency is more clearly seen, as for such businesses, the preferred strategy is not efficiency alone, but a hybrid approach of efficiency (to a certain extent), and politicking. For example, consider the actions of a highly influential winemaker's faction in the city of Arkitsa. When the winemakers in the neighboring city of Kalipso expand their production, Kapliso wines start to show up in the markets of Arkitsa, and the people, seeing that Kalipso wines costs less, and are of higher quality, prefer them. But after a while, the market inspector of Arkista intervenes, and declares a prohibition on the sale of all Kalipso wines. (This causes inefficiency, by the way)\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            So who is culprit behind this prohibition? From one perspective, we might say that this was the fault of the state (the city government), afterall, it was the inspector, an agent of the state, that declared the prohibition. But what if the inspector were elected by vote, and there were many voters that were involved in the winemaking process? Then was the prohibition the doing of the state, or a result of the passive influence of the winemaker's faction? Or it may even be the case that the winemakers faction of Arkitsa, having intelligence on the Kalipso winemakers, and knowing that their own wines could not compete against their's, hatched a plan to sell stake in the wine industry to previously un-invested voters at low cost, increasing their influence over the inspector. Then in this case, would not the prohibition of the Kalipso wines have been a result of the active politicking of the Arkitsa winemaker's faction instead?\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Why Efficiency Cannot be the Morality of Business</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n\r\n            At this point, in our state, it is commonly known that influential business are actively involved in the process of politicking (for starters think \"lobbying\"), which in many cases, undermine the efficiency of the market. But it's the presence of this counter efficient behavior precisely, that reveals the true intentions of business, which is survival, and any incidental efficiency produced, just being instrumental. And in the same way that a prince cannot occupy a country without the co-operation of the natives [Machiavelli, Concerning Mixed Principalities], a state cannot create an efficient economy without the co-operation of the businesses, and the businesses, being mostly preoccupied with their own survival, have no true intention of creating an efficient economy, and for that reason, they will never create an efficienct economy without an illiberal amount of coercion, which would not be tolerated in our state. And so, because the market will never produce an efficient economy, efficiency cannot be its implicit morality.\r\n        </Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text variant=\"h4\"><b>Works Cited</b></Text>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <Text>\r\n            Excerpt from \"Morality, Competition, and the Firm\", by Joseph Heath\r\n            <br/>\r\n            \"The Prince\", by Niccolo Machiavelli\r\n        </Text>\r\n        </Bass>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TheTrueMotivationOfBusiness\r\n","import {\r\n        AppBar,\r\n        Container,\r\n        Button,\r\n        Card,\r\n        Toolbar,\r\n        Typography,\r\n        Link,\r\n        IconButton,\r\n        makeStyles\r\n    } from '@material-ui/core'\r\nimport {Text} from './colorful-text'\r\n\r\nlet useStyles = makeStyles(theme => (\r\n    {\r\n        title: {\r\n            flexGrow: 1,\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n))\r\n\r\nlet AppFooter = () => {\r\n    let classes = useStyles()\r\n    return (\r\n        <Container maxWidth=\"md\">\r\n            <Toolbar disableGutters={true}>\r\n                <span className={classes.title}><Text variant=\"body2\">This is a footer</Text></span>\r\n                <Text variant=\"body2\">e-mail: josephdong1998@gmail.com</Text>\r\n            </Toolbar>\r\n        </Container>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AppFooter\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/xd.727c59a1.jpg\";","import { createMuiTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport AppHeader from './AppHeader';\r\nimport {createStore} from 'redux'\r\nimport {Provider} from 'react-redux'\r\nimport * as Articles from './articles'\r\nimport AppFooter from './AppFooter.js'\r\nimport {\r\n    BrowserRouter as Router,\r\n    Switch,\r\n    Route,\r\n    Link\r\n} from 'react-router-dom'\r\nimport {Idea} from './colorful-text'\r\n\r\nimport xd2 from './assets/xd.jpg'\r\n\r\n// ideas are red\r\n// information is yellow\r\n// chests are brown\r\n// portals are green\r\n// teleporters are purple\r\n\r\n\r\nlet theme = createMuiTheme({\r\n    palette: {\r\n        primary: {\r\n            main: '#f3ef94',\r\n        },\r\n        secondary: {\r\n            main: '#e6e6e6',\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    typography: {\r\n        fontFamily: [\r\n            'sans-serif',\r\n        ].join(','),\r\n    },\r\n})\r\n\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n    <div style={{backgroundImage: `url(${xd2})`, minHeight: '100vh'}}>\r\n\r\n        <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>\r\n            <React.StrictMode>\r\n                <Router>\r\n                    <AppHeader/>\r\n                    <Switch>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/the-evolutionary-origins-of-truth\">\r\n                            <Articles.TheEvolutionaryOriginsOfTruth/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/the-true-motivation-of-business\">\r\n                            <Articles.TheTrueMotivationOfBusiness/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/speculation-on-paul-vanderklays-god-number-2\">\r\n                            <Articles.SpeculationOnPaulVanderklaysGodNumber2/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/scientific-theories-as-truth\">\r\n                            <Articles.ScientificTheoriesAsTruth/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/the-virus-of-progress\">\r\n                            <Articles.TheVirusOfProgress/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/most-trees-are-blue\">\r\n                            <Articles.MostTreesAreBlue/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                        <Route path=\"/\">\r\n                            <Articles.Introductions/>\r\n                        </Route>\r\n                    </Switch>\r\n                </Router>\r\n                <AppFooter/>\r\n            </React.StrictMode>\r\n        </ThemeProvider>\r\n  </div>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
