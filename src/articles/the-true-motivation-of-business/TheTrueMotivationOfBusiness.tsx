        The True Intention of Business
        </ArticleSection>

        According to Heath, when businesses in the market operate freely, prices are driven to market clearing levels, and that justifies their operation [Heath, 6]. On first inspection, this seems like a good justification, because if allowing free enterprise, (which is conducive to liberty,) also maximizes the prosperity of our citizens, then why would we disallow such an economic system? But while this account is very favorable, it doesn't seem to work out empirically, as from our observations of markets in real life, while it is true that we do see a tendency towards efficiency, that is not the only, (and I posit not the primary,) tendency that we see. It seems to me that efficiency is only an instrumental tendency of businesses, and that its true tendency is something more akin to statehood.

        The Desire for Self-Preservation
        </ArticleSection>

        <ArticleText>
        Nowadays when poeple think of power, what comes to mind is probably a state, as in our time, states are the most prominent (and stable) type of power. But state is not the only type power, and power is not one, but fractal, as there are powers within powers, and powers form complicated webs of alliances. But since powers live and die, like us, they do not wish to stagnate and rot, but instead they compete in darwinion fashion within the realm of powers. Militaries, which are a power within the state, have been known to become the state (military coups), and businesses, commonly thought of as a lower power, have been known to become the military (mercenary armies), or even suzerains of another state (corporations as suzerains of banana republics). So powers live, die, and compete, and powers of a certain class, can evolve into powers of another class, so in the end, they are not so different, as they all share the same darwinion urge for self preservation, and thus strive towards statehood.

        Efficiency is Instrumental to Power and Thus Survival
        </ArticleSection>

        <ArticleText>
        The instrumentality of efficiency to power, is the result of the current order of the world, whereby power is predicated on influence, influence on dependence, and dependence on efficiency (which attracts people). The people are attracted to efficiency for the reason that efficiency improves their material conditions, but efficiency, especially the type brought about by hyper-specialization, does not come without the cost of dependence. For behold, in our society, the people have a great neurotic fear of unemployment, the reason being that while it is true that those who are employed have access to the necessities of life at low cost, those who are not, being part of a specialized society, have forgotten the old ways of self-sufficiency, and so become paupers. And it is for this reason, that efficiency then develops into a dependence, and this dependence into a love, and admiration for our captor, the corporation who provides for us, and so, we grant it our power, and it gains influence.

        Self-Preservation Seen in Influential Business
        </ArticleSection>

        <ArticleText>
        In the case of those businesses already with high influence, the true instrumental nature of efficiency is more clearly seen, as for such businesses, the preferred strategy is not efficiency alone, but a hybrid approach of efficiency (to a certain extent), and politicking. For example, consider the actions of a highly influential winemaker's faction in the city of Arkitsa. When the winemakers in the neighboring city of Kalipso expand their production, Kapliso wines start to show up in the markets of Arkitsa, and the people, seeing that Kalipso wines costs less, and are of higher quality, prefer them. But after a while, the market inspector of Arkista intervenes, and declares a prohibition on the sale of all Kalipso wines. (This causes inefficiency, by the way)

        So who is culprit behind this prohibition? From one perspective, we might say that this was the fault of the state (the city government), afterall, it was the inspector, an agent of the state, that declared the prohibition. But what if the inspector were elected by vote, and there were many voters that were involved in the winemaking process? Then was the prohibition the doing of the state, or a result of the passive influence of the winemaker's faction? Or it may even be the case that the winemakers faction of Arkitsa, having intelligence on the Kalipso winemakers, and knowing that their own wines could not compete against their's, hatched a plan to sell stake in the wine industry to previously un-invested voters at low cost, increasing their influence over the inspector. Then in this case, would not the prohibition of the Kalipso wines have been a result of the active politicking of the Arkitsa winemaker's faction instead?

        Why Efficiency Cannot be the Morality of Business
        </ArticleSection>

        <ArticleText>
            At this point, in our state, it is commonly known that influential business are actively involved in the process of politicking (for starters think "lobbying"), which in many cases, undermine the efficiency of the market. But it's the presence of this counter efficient behavior precisely, that reveals the true intentions of business, which is survival, and any incidental efficiency produced, just being instrumental. And in the same way that a prince cannot occupy a country without the co-operation of the natives [Machiavelli, Concerning Mixed Principalities], a state cannot create an efficient economy without the co-operation of the businesses, and the businesses, being mostly preoccupied with their own survival, have no true intention of creating an efficient economy, and for that reason, they will never create an efficient economy without an illiberal amount of coercion, which would not be tolerated in our state. And so, because the market will never produce an efficient economy, efficiency cannot be its implicit morali
