            <Text>
                Paul VanderKlay is a Youtuber and a minister of a Christian Reformed church in Sacramento, California. Out of the goodness of his heart, he has dedicated many hours of his life to explaining concepts about God, and Christianity to the general public, and he has since amassed a sizable following (18.7 thousand followers as of June 25th, 2021) considering the fact that many people nowadays are not very interested in hearing people talk at length about God. In his lectures, he often refers to God as a multifaceted thing-being-force, noting that there are at least two salient conceptions of God, God number 1, and God number 2. God number 1, which is the common folk conception of God among Christians and Atheists alike, is God as superman, infinite speed, infinite strength, infinite intellect. This is the type of God that we commonly debate about, and is even the default concept of God in this course. But the interesting thing is that when we really pay attention, and press people on their true meaning of God, this is not necessarily the type of God that we find in their hearts, while on the outside they will repeat the common notion of God number 1, on the inside, we find that the type of God that they experience is a some sort of personal God, a feeling, an emotion, a "transcendental vision of goodness".
                <br/><br/>


                Now although Paul has never explicitly stated what he means by God number 2, I have decided to take one for the team, and to bear the blame for if I'm wrong, but I will claim now, for the sake of illustration, that God number 2 is a "transcendental vision of goodness". And what I mean by that, is a vision of morality, and purpose that goes beyond ourselves, in the sense that, it is better to use my resources to help someone else in need, rather than to increase the luxury of my own life, or that it is better to sacrifice my personal comfort in order to maintain a friendship, rather than to let it go.
                <br/><br/>
                Now, to test out this hypothesis, and to expand our understanding of what God is, I propose that we do some sort of experiment, where whenever I say God, I want you to replace that word in your mind with "a transcendental vision of goodness". And my hypothesis is that when I use the word "God", what I write will sound like I took a page straight out of the orthodox Christian doctrine, but when you replace that word with "a transcendental vision of goodness" in your mind, then it will sound like I am speaking about ethical theory
                <br/><br/>
                For example, if it were the case that God (a transcendental vision of goodness) exists, then ought we not to live our lives in accordance, and striving towards God (that transcendental vision of goodness). For how can we, if we know that God exists, live with ourselves knowing that we have chosen to reject him? Basically implying that if we know that there is a higher standard of morals, but we decide to actively reject it, then how can we consider ourselves as ethical people.
                <br/><br/>
                If God is that transcendental vision of goodness, then simply by definition, God ought to be morally perfect. For if God is not perfect, then that thing which we call God, is not the true God, but a false one.
                <br/><br/>
                Since the will of God has been revealed to us through visions, and holy texts, the existence of these things means that God wills for us to apply them, and since we can only do the will of God if we're able to, then we must be able to, and that ability is free will. This is basically saying that since the idea of a transcendental goodness is salient, then that idea must have some significance to us, but the idea of a transcendental goodness is useless if we cannot actually work towards it. So in some way, if we believe in a transcendental goodness, and want that belief to actually matter, then we are also forced to adopt a belief in free will, because the purpose of an ideal is to strive towards it, so if you believe that you can't (which is a lack of free will), then there is no purpose in believing in that ideal in the first place.
                <br/><br/>
                If God has given us a body, and we are free to use it in ways that glorify him, then why should we fear death? For if its the case that we die in old age, after having spent a lifetime in the garden, in the presence of God, then we should die without regret, for while we were alive and able, we have done what was good. But if we die at a young age, or suddenly, and have not yet completed the cultivation our virtues, then our death should be mourned, for there was potential, but that potential was never actualized. This is basically saying that if "God", (and this time we're using the idea of God in a more personal sense because it feels right,) has given us a body, which more or less just means that "since we find ourselves to have a body" or "since the 'universe' has given us a body", then we ought to use our body to do tasks which exemplify our vision of what is the transcendental goodness. And with regards to dying, we should not fear death if we have lived virtuously and without regret, but only if we have not yet become a virtuous person should we be afraid, and this gives us the motivation to become virtuous now, and not later.
                <br/><br/>
                Put your trust in God, for God is good, for if you put your faith in the light, it will lead you salvation, and the worship of false idols will destroy you. If you put your trust in the transcendental vision of goodness, assuming that it is the ultimate transcendental vision of goodness, then by definition, you will have lived the most virtuous life, and the life that was full of the most goodness, and that is your salvation. And the worship of a false idol, which is the belief in a faulty transcendental vision of goodness, will lead you astray, and make you live unvirtuously, all the while still believing that you are virtuous, and this will destroy your soul.
