            Why I Believe in Free Will and Determinism
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
            As we live and walk around in our world, we perceive different things through our senses, and so over time, we come to form certain conclusions about the things that we see. Through my own experiences, I have come to the belief that I have a free will, and that the universe is deterministic.

            The Contradiction of Free Will and Determinism
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
            However, for us who hold these beliefs, there is an obvious contradiction that is staring us in the face, for if deterministic means that the materials in the universe are governed by the laws of physics, then we people, who are made of materials, must also be governed by the same laws, and if we are governed by the laws of physics, then how can we be governed by our own free wills?

            <br/>
            <br/>

            But this is the mystery, for if it&apos;s contradiction for us to hold these beliefs, then why do we all behave as if we do hold these beliefs? Because if you order a burrito at a Mexican restaurant, the burritoista will ask you "black or refried beans", implying that there&apos;s a choice. And whenever you get into your car, (just by your actions alone,) you are implicitly believing that whatever physics made your car run yesterday, will continue to make your car run today.

      Our Flawed Metaphysics of Truth
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
      So the reason why I believe that what we believe is a contradiction (I&apos;m claiming that how people behave, and not what they say indicates what they truly they believe, btw), is really not the fault of what we believe, but instead is just the result of us having a flawed metaphysics of truth, as in our modern culture we seem to only be salient about one aspect of truth (the binary and absolute), and not the other. But I posit that truth is actually multifaceted, and that there are actually two different kinds of truth formal, and darwinion.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      When I say formal truth, I mean a kind of truth that is derived from a formalized system of reasoning. Take statistical theory for example, in the system that is statistical theory, we say that it is possible, (under certain circumstances and assumptions,) to conduct a study to tell if cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. If it were the case that exposure to asbestos, and smog were the only confounding variables for lung cancer, then in our study, if we were to split the participants into three groups (exposure to smog, exposure to asbestos, and everyone else), then any correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer that we find within each of these groups is a direct causation. This is the kind of truth that is well behaved, binary, and absolute, and what most people in our culture think of when we say truth.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      But the other kind of truth, which is really the one that we&apos;re interested in today, is a darwinion truth, which is more or less a though pattern that persists over time, examples of these kinds of truth would be things like "our father is in heaven", or "God has given us a free will". Now of course, I'm not claiming that superstitions are truth, but what I think that many people nowadays fail to understand is that religion is not mere superstition, and in some sense, I believe that these things which I have labeled as darwinion truth are even truer than the formal truth itself, as I soon hope to convince you that formalized truth is actually just a derivative of the more generalized darwinion truth.

      How Ideas Evolve Over Time
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
      Now what I'm calling darwinion truth, I believe is really just an extension of pragmatic truth, so I believe that we can motivate darwinion truth by simply adopting the pragmatic attitude, which is to grant an idea or belief to be true, and to judge it by seeing what its practical effects are [James, Lecture VI Pragmatism's Conception of Truth]. And in the case for darwinion truth, the practical effect that matters to us is its contribution to (darwinion) fitness.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      Now the way in which a thought pattern affects the fitness of a person is though influencing their behavioral patterns, for example, if a person is believes that their life has no purpose, and that their birth was a mistake, then they will behave in ways that reflect those beliefs, for example, they may neglect to take care of themselves, or they may act resentfully towards their parents, and those actions would be detrimental to their fitness. So where genetics are a physical encoding of information who's viability is expressed through the quality of the body of a person, ideas are a mental encoding of information who's viability is expressed though the quality of the actions of a person. And just like genetics (and any other thing that contributes to the fitness of a person), ideas will also go through a process of natural selection, where over time, the ideas that result in good fitness are remembered, and those that are not, are lost to the sands of time, and those ideas that are remembered are then spread, and so they live on, and mutate, (and by mutate, I mean that the idea is able to be "iterated" upon, in the sense that rock music is an iteration of blues music).

      The Legitimacy of Darwinion Truth
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
      But of course, just because an idea is evolutionary successful, it does not mean that we should call it truth. But the reason why I see it as truth is because truth itself is just a category, and since it is held in high esteem, it must have some sort of function that distinguishes itself from other categories, and I posit that that function is its ability to produce desirable results when applied. For example, lets take a formalized truth like "smoking causes lung cancer", why do we say that this statement is true? Well you might say that its true because the result comes from statistical theory, but why don't we first take a step back, because to me, it seems like that statement derives its legitimacy from the fact that when applied, it produces desired results, in the sense that if we convince the public of the opposite, and encourage smoking, then we would have an absolute disaster of a heath crisis on our hands.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      But even if you do not believe me, and insist that the reason why that statement is true, is not due to that fact that it produces good results, but due to that fact that it comes from statistical theory, then let me ask you, why do results that come from statistical theory have legitimacy? You might be tempted to say that the reason for why results that come from statistical theory have legitimacy, is because statistical theory is derived from logic, and logic is the fundamental system that derives all truth. But is that really true? Because if logic is what produces truth, and truth serves no special function, then truth is just another category, and doesn't deserve to be held in high esteem. The reason why we hold logic in high esteem, and we mistakenly see it as the source of truth, is because logic is able to produce powerful systems of reasoning, like statistics, and physics, etc., and those systems that logic creates produces good results. So in the end, even if this statement ultimately derives its legitimacy from logic, logic itself derives its legitimacy from producing good results, so this statement still derives its legitimacy from its ability to produce good results.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      Now this is were we come to the view of truth that I advocate for, which is more or less a re-framed version of the pragmatic truth, which is that ideas that produce good results are true, and what evolution is, is that system which selects for these true ideas over time. And so these so called darwinion truths, which are the ideas that have persisted over the long run, are basically the truest ideas. So from this point of view, the logical system itself is simply one of these darwinion truths, and not the real source of it all.

      Darwinion Truth and Free Will and Determinism
        </ty.ArticleSection>

        <ty.ArticleText gutter slightlySmaller>
      But now onto the topic of free will and determinism, what I posit is that both the belief in free will, and the belief in determinism, are darwinion truths, and that the belief in free will, being a more ancient one, is thus truer than our belief in determinism. And also since these beliefs are so ingrained into our culture and language, and that our culture is also prestigious (although the prestige of our culture is currently waning), these things point to the belief in free will and determinism being darwinion.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      But to elaborate and to provide some post-hoc justification, we can say that it was our belief in free will that allowed us to strive towards the creation of a better society, for if we believed that we did not have free will, then we could not possibly make any efforts towards that goal, as we could only ride on the tide of history, but not shape it. And if we did not believe in free will, then we could also not justify punishing people for their ill deeds, and honoring them for their good deeds, and we could also not decide to take responsibility for our own actions, and to discipline ourselves to become better citizens, and if we could not do that, then we could not strive to reach the ultimate goal, which is self-actualization. And the reason for why we believe in determinism, is that that belief provides the motivation for us to to study the world around us, and to search for patterns in the natural world, which is the foundation of all of our scientific endeavors.

            <br/>
            <br/>

      And since these beliefs have both stood the test of time, and proven to be beneficial for us, we ought to call them truth, as these things are the fundamental purpose of truth, and that since these ideas are more fundamental than logic itself, logic telling us that that they are a contradiction is not a reason for us to abandon them.
